A unity game made as a final project for ICS4U0. It was inspired by Angry Birds and is coded in C#.

***

I created a 2D Unity game inspired by Angry Birds with a peer, using Unityâ€™s physics engine to perfect object behaviour in space. This includes ball movement after the user launches it, chaos after the ball interacts with several other independent objects, and determining whether enough force was generated to defeat snowman objects.

I designed 10 levels of engaging gameplay with a peer developer. The UI was designed to be user-friendly, appealing to all ages, with the animations being easy to follow and attractive. The game includes a tutorial and a level selection screen. We determined programming tasks to be completed and divided them such that our individually-completed software could be integrated smoothly and efficiently.
